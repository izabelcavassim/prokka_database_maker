This is a tool for creating genus databases for Prokka.  The input is a list of ncbi taxids.  This program finds each taxid in the ncbi taxonomy tree, identifies all descendants, downloads the associated genome files from ncbi, and creates a single  Prokka genus database.

This tool is good for looking up ncbi taxonomy id's http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/TaxIdentifier/tax_identifier.cgi
